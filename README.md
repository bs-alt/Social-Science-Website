## Generating quiz PDFs

Quiz PDFs for the project can be created using the helper script
`scripts/generate_village_palampur_quiz_pdf.py`. Run the script from the
repository root with:

```bash
python3 scripts/generate_village_palampur_quiz_pdf.py
```

After running the command, the resulting PDF is written to the
`class9-socialscience/quizzes/` directory.
